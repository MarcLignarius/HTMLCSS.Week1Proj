            <p>Thanks for stopping by and welcome to my coding portfolio! I'm Marc, I live in Portland with my wife Mimi and our baby daughter Chloe. I'm originally from Bordeaux, France and have dual French/American citizenship.</p>
            <p>Some of the things I enjoy most outside of coding are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Playing music:</strong> I play guitar, bass and drums. Cool story 1: I played drums in a band while living in Ireland, we recorded a demo and the national music magazine picked it up as "Demo of the month". Cool story 2: I played bass for a band in Los Angeles who had recorded with Steve Albini, who produced Nirvana's <em>In Utero</em>. </li>
              <li><strong>Listening to music:</strong> My favorite genres are metal and punk but over the years I found that no matter what the genre, there's great - and not so great - music everywhere. I also like to nerd out about metal and how many genres of metal there are and how you might actually really enjoy some of them.</li>
              <li><strong>Playing Poker:</strong> I've been playing on and off for the past 10 years or so but have only recently started working on my game more seriously. Poker, like coding, evolves constantly. What I love most is how intricate the game is and how many levels of thinking you have to go into to beat your smartest opponents. For a game where you're only holding two cards and some chips, it can be either exhilirating or soul crushing.</li>
