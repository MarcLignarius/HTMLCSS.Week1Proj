            <p>Thanks for stopping by and welcome to my programming portfolio! I'm Marc, I live in Portland with my wife Mimi and our baby daughter Chloe. I'm originally from Bordeaux, France and have dual French/American citizenship.</p>
            <p>Some of the things I enjoy most outside of programming are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Playing music:</strong> I play guitar, bass and drums. Cool story 1: I played drums in a band while living in Ireland, we recorded a demo and the national music magazine picked it up as "Demo of the month". Cool story 2: I played bass for a band in Los Angeles who had recorded with Steve Albini, who produced Nirvana's <em>In Utero</em>. </li>
              <li><strong>Listening to music:</strong> My favorite genres are metal and punk but over the years I found that no matter what the genre, there's great - and not so great - music everywhere. I also like to nerd out about metal and how many genres of metal there are and how you might actually really enjoy some of them.</li>
              <li><strong>Playing Poker:</strong> I've been playing on and off for the past 10 years or so but have only recently started working on my game more seriously. Poker, like coding languages, evolves constantly. What I love most is how intricate the game is and how many levels of thinking you have to go into to beat your smartest opponents. For a game where you're only holding two cards and some chips, it can be either exhilirating or soul crushing.</li>

            <h2 class="panel-title">Education and Work Experience</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>I went to school in France and then went on to business school where one semester was spent in Bordeaux and the other at the University of Portsmouth, England. I graduated with a <span class="important">Bachelor of Arts</span> in International Business.</p>
            <p>While working at Riot Games I studied Agile software development and received my <span class="important">ICAgile Certified Professional</span> certification. This is when I was also first introduced to the notion of the growth mindset. More recently I was interested in Amazon Web Services so I studied and became an <span class="important">AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner</span>.</p>
            <p>I previously worked at <a class="important" href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> as a Customer Care Advisor. It's a great company with an amazing product and a fantastic company culture. Before that I spent 5 years at <a class="important" href="https://www.riotgames.com">Riot Games </a> where I worked as a Player Support Specialist, a Product Owner and finally a Community Manager. Both experiences have shaped my desire to learn how to program in different ways. I talk about this more under <em>"Why Programming?</em>.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Two experiences have led me to begin my programming journey.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Working at <a class="important" href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>, a popular website builder.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a class="important" href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> provides software as a service for website building and hosting. Its customers use pre-built website templates and drag and drop elements to create webpages. While working there I always wondered how Squarespace's platform was coded to be able to handle so many complex changes (sometimes a complete site remodel) while providing this simple interface to its customers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working at <a class="important" href="https://www.riotgames.com">Riot Games</a> as the Product Owner of an application.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Riot Games is the producer of League of Legends, arguably one of the most popular video games of this decade. Working as a Product Owner for an application, I remember thinking in every sprint meeting <em>"man, I really want to learn how to build something like this"</em>.

            <p>Learning how to program is also an excellent way of developing and cultivating a growth mindset, which is something I've struggled with at times.</p>
